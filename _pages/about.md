## Profile
I am a confident, articulate professional with experience in consulting, software development and teaching. I am an excellent problem solver and bring an innovative approach to all projects I work on. I have a keen business awareness with a focus on efficient project delivery.

## Professional Experience
**ERCE, Senior Reservoir Engineer, Oct 2013 – Present**
*ERCE (www.erce.energy) is a London-based reservoir evaluation consultancy. ERCE provides technical and commercial advisory services to exploration and production companies and the financial sector*
* Key role in the preparation and delivery of an Expert Witness testimony during the successful defence of a $US ~200 million UK High Court claim regarding the fair market value of the Kurovdag oil field, Azerbaijan
* Lead role in the design and calibration of a complex subsurface model of a producing oil field. The 3D discretised model is solved numerically to predict future oil production rates. Leveraged AWS high-speed cloud computing to efficiently deliver forecasts for real-time business decisions
* Company authority on all statistical and stochastic modelling as well as having introduced new mathematical approaches leading to more rigorous forecasting methods
Broad experience in different project types, from detailed technical studies to M&A transaction advisory, with a track record for consistently delivering results on time and on budget
* Comfortable working with large datasets and incorporating information from various disciplines to make informed project decisions
Good communicator with the ability to present results clearly and concisely in presentation and report format

**Tendeka, Development Engineer, June – Sept 2012**
*Tendeka, an oil and gas services company, builds the software package FloQuest. FloQuest allows users to visualize and analyse the large amounts of data collected during continuous down-hole temperature measurements*
* Worked in the software branch of the company, developing and implementing new algorithms that automatically convert temperature sensor traces into wellbore inflow profiles  

**University of Western Australia, University Mathematics Tutor, Jan – June 2012**
*Faculty of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences*
* Delivered seminars to large classes of undergraduate students covering a wide range of mathematics topics

**Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Researcher, Sep - Dec 2011**
*The research centre focuses on collaborative research with industry and promoting a wider use of mathematical models*
* A 4-month independent research project investigating modelling disease outbreaks on complex networks using Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms written in Matlab

## Education
**Imperial College London, MSc Petroleum Engineering (Distinction), 2012 - 2013**
* Dissertation (Distinction): “Development of a novel method for the probabilistic valuation of oil and gas prospects” - this new model allows uncertainty to be correctly propagated from the initial geological evaluation through to the final economic valuation.

**University of Oxford, BA Mathematics (2:1), 2008 - 2011**
* Specialisation in Applied Mathematics including modules in Differential Equations, Numerical Methods and Applied Probability
* Awarded an ‘Exhibition’ for academic achievement
